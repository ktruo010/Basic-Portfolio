            Born and rasied in California, I am very happy to finally to take the leap and learn how to code! I have
            always seen software developers and software engoineers as wizards. I am very excited to finally build
            out all my crazy ideas with my own hands! I graduated with a concentration in Accounting and Finance
            becuase that is what my Accountant father had recommened, Hah! And although I am glad to have those
            skills, I think I will enjoy coding much more! I currenlty work at a software company as a Technical
            Project Manager and it is great! The company is called Ytel, and we are a communications company!
